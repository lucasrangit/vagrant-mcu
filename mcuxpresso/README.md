# MCUxpresso

## Setup

1. Copy the contents of this folder to your project directory.
1. Go to https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com and download the required SDK archive. The NXP SDK Builder doesn't allow direct downloads so save this on your own server and serve it from there to ensure the setup is repeatable.
1. Set the `SDK` variable in `setup.sh` to the SDK downloaded.
1. `./setup.sh`

## Run

1. `./start.sh`

The SDK will be detected and imported automatically after a few seconds.
